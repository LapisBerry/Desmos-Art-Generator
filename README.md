## About This Repositories

I saw this on replit.com when I was like 14 years old. I just like it!!!🔥 (btw, that one I found wasn't from Archimedes Li 😉 and I couldn't tell if I forgot some informations.)

I made this repositories because I can keep the knowledge about [convolution.js] and [vectorize.js] in folder [image_processing]

One day, I turn a picture from one of my friend into roughly 35000+ equations.💀 I have to plot it so many times because the website will crash if I put all the 35000+ equations simultaneously.😭 So I decided to put 5000 equations 8 times instead to make it works. My computer was crying lol.🤣 It was so laggy and it crashed so many times. Good thing is after I plot all the equations I capture my screen and send it to one of my friend. She was so satisfy,💖 she likes it a lot even though the quality of the picture is very low. Um... Thanks for the code [Archimedes Li]. Thanks for being in a part of our memories.
